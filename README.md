YATRI is a collaborative learning project built by a group of friends with a shared passion for travel and web development. It serves as a modern travel hub where users can discover popular trekking destinations across Nepal. Designed with a clean and dynamic UI, the platform showcases destination cards featuring scenic images and key information. While currently focused only on treks within Nepal, the project is a foundation for learning and growing as developers.
